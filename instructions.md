# Project overview
You are building an AI personal learning assistant, which will help users distill key summaries and insights from various articles, youtube videos, blog posts, and long-form documents. This will be a personal learning repository in the form of a web app, where key takeaways per resource will be organised in a structured manner, and subdivided / grouped by both form of medium, topic / themes, and date. 

You will be using NextJS14, Shadcn, tailwind, Lucid icon

# Core functionalities
1. Create concise bulleted summaries of articles, youtube videos, blog posts and long-form documents
    1. Group bullets thematically / topically by clear subheading, yet remaining an element of chronology with original medium
    2. Provide link to original medium within th summary
    3. Ability to share summaries through a link with other users of the platform
    4. Users should have the ability to specify how concise they would like the summaries to be (give them 3 options) and the style (e.g. academic, personal, etc)
2. Store them in a clear and structured manner, subdivided by theme, form of content and date
    1. Landing page showing recent summaries by date
    2. Colour-coded by theme (user should be able to originally specify the themes they are after) and clearly presented in chronological order
    3. Seperate pages clustered by theme and medium, with relevant summaries also included there
    4. Each summary should have its own page, a little like the summaries generated by Granola (granola.ai)
3. Ability for users to specify the particular elements / key learnings they are after, which should inform how the tool generates summaries
    1. Upon original sign-up, users should receive a little questionnaire on how they would like to use the tool - which topics they are after, and then as above the style of the summaries they would like to receive
    2. There should be an ability for users to edit these preferences over time, as their interests and needs change
4. Users to either upload links to the relevant documents, but also little widget that pops up upon streaming the internet if articles and content consumed by users fit their specified areas of interest (with a little pop-up saying "Should we generate summary" or something similar)
    1. Similar to Granola.AI where upon calls / messages / etc a little pop-up occurs with a suggestion to take notes
    2. Ability for users to create reading lists, which the AI should be able to summarise once those articles are read by users (e.g. by following the link through the web app, or through tracking via cookies if possible)
    3. Also maintain ability for users to manually post links into the app to summarise, and AI should atomically assort date, theme, and medium
5. Ability to search through the entire repository of summaries by words, phrases, or themes
    1. Maintain a search bar on the top of the page, which allows users to search through the entire repository of summaries by words, phrases, or themes
6. Ability of tool to generate links between different summaries, and make suggestions to user on how they interact
7. Specific pages by theme / medium
8. Ability for users to complement the notes or summaries generated by the AI tool, and ability for users to add the first few bullets and AI to enhance summaries thereafter
9. Ability to download the entire summary of a particular theme / medium, or even the entire repository of summaries
    1. Also a social element, via which users can share summaries with each other
